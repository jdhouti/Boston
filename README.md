# Boston

A project set to calculate the average percent body fat (pbf) over time, for four individuals.
It will calculate this average based on a formula provided by Jesse Boston at the University of Virginia.
It will record those averages in four separate files and then graph the results over time using four linear lines. Data is stored in text files so that the data can be updated by the program after every iteration without the need of leaving it running in the background.

Some features to consider include eliminating the need for external files and replace it with an access to a small relational database to store the data inputted by the user.
